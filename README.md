# MyPHPEvaluation
A simple repo to evaluate an entry level software developer

## To Run
* Clone or download this repository to your computer. 
* Download and install PHP on your machine. 
 *  You can use something like XAMPP however, PHP is all that is required to run this program. Once PHP is installed run the command below. 
 * If PHP is not in your $PATH environment variable, you'll need to provide the path to your PHP install from the command line.

`$ /path/to/php index.php`

## Tips
 * Use error reporting to see what errors exist and fix them.
 * Use resources like PHP.net or Stackoverflow to help you find answers

## When will you know you're done?
You'll know you're done when you get a nice message in the console output. However, getting there is the challenge. The purpose of this is not simply to figure out the output message but to get the program to output the message by fixing the errors in the code.
